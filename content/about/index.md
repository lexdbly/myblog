I am someone who enjoys to analyse things thoroughly and try to make life simpler without compromising too much from its complexity. This habit may come from engineering education or just a creative way of pursuing life.

I enjoy discussing philosophy, playing piano, and programming in my spare times. I write simple programs and try to automate boring tasks. You will be sharing my programming journey with me on this blog and I hope you will find some handy information for yourself.

Enjoy your visit!
