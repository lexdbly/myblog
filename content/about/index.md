There are times I wish I was living in renassiance times because of the value of generalists and philosophers of that time. Today my biggest struggle has been turning myself into a specialist. According to JP, sacrifice is a necessity before broadening your knowledge and expertise. Therefore, one must undertake the duty of sacrifice, and must choose what to give up in life in order to win something bigger than himself. I am currently discovering what to give up and how to commit myself into a thing which hopefully in foreseeable future will turn into an asset. Other than that, I am just a curious guy who enjoys discovering new places and discussing ideas.
