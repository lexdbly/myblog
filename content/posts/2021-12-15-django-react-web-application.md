[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), Node Package Manager, is a package manager for JavaScript. Similar to pip, 

## Babel

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transforms your JSX into vanilla JavaScript code.

>Babel is a toolchain that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript in current and older browsers or environments.

## Webpack

[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) minimizes and bundles your code.

>webpack is an open-source JavaScript module bundler. It is a module bundler primarily for JavaScript, but it can transform front-end assets like HTML, CSS, and images if the corresponding loaders are included. webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) allows you to run your JavaScript code on server.

>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser.
